# TF530 Revision 3

WARNING: I have just committed revision 3 of the board. I havent verified this yet.

This repository contains all the files needed to produce a copy of my accelerator board.

The CPLD Required is a XC9572XL-10VQ64.  The CPLD XC9572XL-10VQG64 is the readily available RoHS "Green" lead-free equivalent.

## Firmware / Requirements

  * Xilinx ISE, 14.7 (the final version - other versions may work but this is the one I support)
  * JTAG Adaptor

## The TerribleFore 530 board (Revision 3)

Completely untested board link.... use with caution!!!! Do not come crying to me if it didnt work!!

## The TerribleFire 530 board (Revision 2)

This board is now in Beta. It may not work in all circumstances but it has been verified to boot AmigaOS 1.3, 2.05 and 3.1 and run various games and desktop apps at 25Mhz. Operation is not guarunteed to be crash free but will work in most "happy path" situations.

I have only verified the HD interface with Compact Flash cards.
I have verified this board boots on Amiga 500 Rev 5, 6a, 8.1a

I accept no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. IT IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Installation

As of Revision 3 installation no longer needs the OVR and INT2 signals connected to the Amiga motherboard. The headers remain on the TF530 for testing but do not need to be connected although it should make little difference if they are connected. Well behaved Autoconfig devices will work alongside the TF530. The autoconfig space asserts the internal OVR signal when there are PICs remaining to be configured. After which the autoconfig will probe the standard bus. This revision should work on the A2000 (untested).

IPL0 has not been routed because we only ever need to assert INT2 and/or INT6.
